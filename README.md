# Fibbonnaci-sequence.py
Implements the Fibonacci sequence using simple iterative/recursive logic. Shows how each term is formed by adding the previous two. Useful for practicing functions, loops, and basic recursion. Code is clear, beginner-friendly, and easy to extend or optimize.

ðŸ“˜ About This Project â€” Fibonacci Sequence

This repository provides an implementation of the Fibonacci sequence, a mathematical series in which each term is the sum of the two preceding terms. The sequence begins with 0 and 1, and continues infinitely:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦

The code demonstrates the logic behind generating Fibonacci numbers using common programming approaches such as iterative loops and recursion. It is designed to help learners understand function structure, algorithmic thinking, and step-by-step computation.

Key concepts highlighted include:

1. How to define a function to compute Fibonacci values
2. Use of loops to generate sequences efficiently
3. Introduction to recursive function calls
4. Basic time-complexity considerations

This project is useful for beginners exploring algorithms, recursion, and mathematical patterns. It can be extended to explore memoization, dynamic programming, performance comparison, or visualizations of growth patterns.
